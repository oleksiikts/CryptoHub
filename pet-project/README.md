## Tech Stack

### 1. Python
Python has been chosen as the primary programming language for the backend due to its simplicity, power, and extensive library ecosystem. It enables efficient development of complex algorithms for data processing, prediction, and service integration.

### 2. Flask Framework
Flask is the chosen framework for building the web application. This lightweight and flexible framework allows for quick development of server-side applications with minimal time and resource overhead. Flask is ideal for small to medium-sized web services and enables easy integration with necessary components and microservices.

### 3. SQLite Database
SQLite is used for storing user data, preferences, favorite cryptocurrencies, and interaction history. It provides a lightweight, efficient solution for small to medium-sized projects while maintaining high performance and easy integration with Python.

### 4. Frontend (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS)
The frontend of the application uses standard web technologies:
- **HTML** for page structure.
- **CSS** for styling and making the site responsive.
- **Bootstrap** for fast and convenient development of responsive and visually appealing designs.
- **JavaScript** for adding interactivity, event handling, and asynchronous server requests.

These technologies ensure a smooth and pleasant user experience, providing interactive and responsive interfaces.

### 5. API Integration (CoinGecko, Cointelegraph News)
The platform integrates with public APIs to gather real-time cryptocurrency data, news, and market changes:
- **CoinGecko API** provides information on cryptocurrency prices, price changes, and other essential financial metrics.
- **Cointelegraph News API** fetches the latest news from the cryptocurrency world to keep users informed on market trends.

These integrations ensure that the data displayed on the site is up-to-date and accurate.

### 6. Data Analysis with Machine Learning (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly)
For data analysis and predictions, the platform utilizes popular Python libraries:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** for numerical calculations and handling arrays of data.
- **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** for creating charts and visualizations, enabling users to view trends and predict price movements of cryptocurrencies.

These tools allow for the implementation of sophisticated machine learning models to analyze and forecast market behavior.

### 7. Exchange Integration (CCXT)
The platform uses the **CCXT** library for integration with cryptocurrency exchanges. This library provides a convenient interface for connecting to various exchanges, retrieving market data, and tracking trades, prices, and volumes, facilitating automated market monitoring.
